Module 14: Model-View-Controller Challenge: Tech Blog 

## Description

This is a CMS-style blog site, made for developers to be able to publish their blog posts, edit their posts and comment on other developers posts as well. This app follows the MVC paradigm and uses handlebars.js as the templating language, sequelize ORM and express-session npm package for authentication. 

Developers can sign up for an account, log in and see their dashboard with all of their posts they made and sign out afterwards.
